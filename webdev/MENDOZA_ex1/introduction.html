    <h1>Cooking methods in the Philippines</h1>
      <br>
    <!----------------------------------- Introduction ------------------------------------------->
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Filipino cuisine (Filipino: lutuing Pilipino/pagkaing Pilipino) is composed of the cuisines
      of more than a hundred distinct ethno-linguistic groups found throughout the Philippine
      archipelago. However, a majority of mainstream Filipino dishes that compose Filipino cuisine
      are from the cuisines of the various ethnolinguistic groups and tribes of the archipelago,
      including the Ilocano, Pangasinan, Kapampangan, Tagalog, Bicolano, Visayan (Cebuano,
      Hiligaynon and Waray), Chavacano and Maranao ethno-linguistic groups.

    <p>In this page, We will be looking at the foundational methods that make up the majority of 
      Filipino cuisine. We aim to further understand our beloved dishes so that we may use them
      in the appropriate way. For this reason, introduction page will dive head-first and will 
      attempt to articulate everything about the cooking method to shed light into the process of
      using it to give you a taste for what is to come.

    <!------------------------------------ Foundations of cookin --------------------------------->
    <h2>Foundations of cooking</h2>
    <p>Although Filipino food is one of complexity with its varied origins of Malay, Chinese and
      Spanish, yet the cooking methods are rather simple. Basically, the four cooking methods that
      support the foundation of Filipino cookery are boiling (nilaga), grilling (ihaw), roasting (lechon), 
      and frying (prito). These cooking methods form the very basis of the modern-day demand of healthy 
      cooking. It was not until the arrival of the Spanish that the method of sauteeing (guisado) was
      "Filipinized" and introduced into the Filipino kitchen, adding to the basic forms of Filipino 
      cookery. 
    </p>
      <br>
    <p>we will be discussing the cooking methods below</p>
      <hr>
    <!----------------------------------------- Boiling / Nilaga ---------------------------------->
    <h2>Boiling / Nilaga</h2>
      <br>
    <img src="images/boiling.jpg.jpg" alt="image of nilaga">
      <br>
    <p>
      Scientifically speaking, boiling is an explosive phase change between a liquid state and a gas 
      state. In the kitchen, boiling is cooking food at a relatively high temperature, 212 degrees, in 
      water or some other water-based liquid. When liquids boil, bubbles caused by water vapor rush to 
      the surface of the liquid and pop. It’s a vigorous process that works best for sturdier foods; 
      anything delicate can get damaged.
    </p>
      <br>
    <p>
      Boiling is a moist-heat cooking method that happens when the liquid’s temperature reaches 212 
      degrees. Food is completely submerged in water for even heat distribution. The full boil is a 
      vigorous one, where bubbles rapidly and violently break over the entire surface of the water. 
      A slow boil is a lazy boil, almost a simmer, at 205 degrees. In the case of a slow boil, bubbles 
      will slowly break over the surface of the water. Depending on the food you cook, you either have 
      to add it to already boiling water, or add it to cool water and bring it up to boiling 
      temperature; there’s more on that later, down below.

    <!----------------------------------------------- Grilling ----------------------------------->
    <h2>Grilling / Ihaw</h2>
      <br>
    <img src="images/grilling.jpg.jpg" alt="image of inasal on the grill">
      <br>
    <p>
      Grilling is a form of cooking that involves dry heat applied to the surface of food, commonly 
      from above, below or from the side. Grilling usually involves a significant amount of direct, 
      radiant heat, and tends to be used for cooking meat and vegetables quickly. Food to be grilled 
      is cooked on a grill (an open wire grid such as a gridiron with a heat source above or below), 
      using a cast iron/frying pan, or a grill pan (similar to a frying pan, but with raised ridges 
      to mimic the wires of an open grill).
    </p>
      <br>
    <p>
      Heat transfer to the food when using a grill is primarily through thermal radiation. Heat 
      transfer when using a grill pan or griddle is by direct conduction. In the United States, 
      when the heat source for grilling comes from above, grilling is called broiling. In this case, 
      the pan that holds the food is called a broiler pan, and heat transfer is through thermal 
      radiation. Direct heat grilling can expose food to temperatures often in excess of 260 °C 
      (500 °F). Grilled meat acquires a distinctive roast aroma and flavor from a chemical process 
      called the Maillard reaction. The Maillard reaction only occurs when foods reach temperatures 
      in excess of 155 °C (310 °F).

    <!----------------------------------------------- Roasting ------------------------------------>
    <h2>Roasting / Lechon</h2>
      <br>
    <img src="images/lechon.jpg.jpg" alt="an image of lechon">
      <br>
    <p>
      Lechón (Spanish pronunciation: [leˈt͡ʃon]; from leche "milk" + -ón) is a pork dish in several 
      regions of the world, most specifically in Spain and former Spanish colonial possessions 
      throughout the world. Lechón is a Spanish word referring to a roasted baby pig (piglet) which 
      was still fed by suckling its mother's milk (a suckling pig). Lechón is a popular food in 
      Spain, Cuba, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, and other Spanish-speaking nations in Latin 
      America. The dish features a whole roasted suckling pig cooked over charcoal. It has been 
      described as a national dish of Cuba, Puerto Rico, and Spain.
    </p>
      <br>
    <p>
      Additionally, it is popular in the Philippines and other Austronesian regions, whose 
      pig-roasting traditions have native pre-colonial origins. Although it acquired the Spanish 
      name as a general term for "roasted pig", in these regions it more often refers to adult 
      roasted pigs, not lechones (milk suckling pigs). It is also sometimes considered one of the 
      unofficial national dishes of the Philippines, with Cebu being asserted by American chef 
      Anthony Bourdain as having the best pigs.

    <!----------------------------------------------- Sauteeing ------------------------------------>
    <h2>Sauteeing / Guisado</h2>
      <br>
    <img src="images/sauteeing.jpg.jpg" alt="image of sauteed veggies">
      <br>
    <p>
      Ingredients for sautéing are usually cut into small pieces or thinly sliced to provide a large 
      surface area, which facilitates fast cooking. The primary mode of heat transfer during sautéing 
      is conduction between the pan and the food being cooked. Food that is sautéed is browned while 
      preserving its texture, moisture, and flavor. If meat, chicken, or fish is sautéed, the sauté is 
      often finished by deglazing the pan's residue to make a sauce.
    </p>
      <br>
    <p>
      Sautéing may be compared with pan frying, in which larger pieces of food (for example, chops or 
      steaks) are cooked quickly in oil or fat, and flipped onto both sides. Some cooks make a 
      distinction between the two based on the depth of the oil used, while others use the terms 
      interchangeably. Sautéing differs from searing in that searing only browns the surface of the food. Certain oils 
      should not be used to sauté due to their low smoke point. Clarified butter, rapeseed 
      oil and sunflower oil are commonly used for sautéing; whatever the fat, it must have a smoke point 
      high enough to allow cooking on medium-high heat, the temperature at which sautéing is done. For 
      example, though regular butter would produce more flavor, it would burn at a lower temperature and 
      more quickly than other fats due to the presence of milk solids. Clarified butter is more fit for 
      this use.

    <!----------------------------------------------- Frying ------------------------------------>
    <h2>Frying / Prito</h2>
      <br>
    <img src="images/lechonkawali.jpg.jpg" alt="an image of lechon kawali being fried">
      <br>
    <p>
      frying, the cooking of food in hot fats or oils, usually done with a shallow oil bath in a 
      pan over a fire or as so-called deep fat frying, in which the food is completely immersed in 
      a deeper vessel of hot oil. Because the food is heated through a greasy medium, some 
      authorities consider frying to be technically a dry-heat cooking process.
    </p>
      <br>
    <p>
      The technique of frying is ancient, ubiquitous, and highly versatile; it has been used since 
      antiquity and in most cultures to prepare meats and fish, vegetables, and breads. This 
      popularity, together with the fairly low cost of large-scale frying, made fried foods staples 
      of the late 20th-century fast-food industry. Fatty meats such as bacon and ground beef are 
      usually fried in their own rendered fat. Relatively lean meats, fish, and vegetables are 
      often floured or dipped in batter before being fried. More delicate cooking often calls for 
      meats and vegetables to be sautéed—that is, lightly browned in a small amount of butter, light 
      shortening, or oil. In addition to meat drippings, butter, and lard, once easily rendered in 
      the home, commercially produced corn, peanut, and other seed oils are common frying mediums.
