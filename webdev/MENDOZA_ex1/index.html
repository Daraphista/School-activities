    <h1>Cooking methods in the Philippines</h1>
      <br>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Filipino cuisine (Filipino: lutuing Pilipino/pagkaing Pilipino) is composed of the cuisines
      of more than a hundred distinct ethno-linguistic groups found throughout the Philippine
      archipelago. However, a majority of mainstream Filipino dishes that compose Filipino cuisine
      are from the cuisines of the various ethnolinguistic groups and tribes of the archipelago,
      including the Ilocano, Pangasinan, Kapampangan, Tagalog, Bicolano, Visayan (Cebuano,
      Hiligaynon and Waray), Chavacano and Maranao ethno-linguistic groups.

      attempt to articulate everything about the cooking method to shed light into the process of
      using it to give you a taste for what is to come.

    <h2>Foundations of cooking</h2>
    <p>Although Filipino food is one of complexity with its varied origins of Malay, Chinese and Spanish, yet the cooking methods are rather simple. Basically, the four cooking methods that support the foundation of Filipino cookery are boiling (nilaga), grilling (ihaw), roasting and steaming (halabos). These cooking methods form the very basis of the modern-day demand of healthy cooking. It was not until the arrival of the Spanish that the method of sauteeing (guisado) was "Filipinized" and introduced into the Filipino kitchen, adding to the basic forms of Filipino cookery.</p>
