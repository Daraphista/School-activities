          Launched in 2012, Jessica Gavin, the owner of the blog, enjoyed developing & sharing recipes 
          in my home test kitchen where I’m able to infuse food science knowledge in every recipe. I love the challenge of creating eye-catching 
          dishes while maintaining the quality of the product and balancing flavors.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the hunger to still learn about different aspects of food, Jessica Gavin studied 
          Culinary Arts at The Art Institute in Santa Ana while working full-time. In culinary 
          school, She learned how to combine my food science knowledge with the products I produced 
          in each class. She was finally able to demystify some of my fears in cooking and learned 
          how to properly prepare some of my favorite foods.

          Wikipedia is an online free content encyclopedia project helping create a world in which 
          everyone can freely share in the sum of all knowledge. It is supported by the Wikimedia 
          Foundation and based on a model of freely editable content. The name "Wikipedia" is a 
          blending of the words wiki (a technology for creating collaborative websites, from the 
          Hawaiian word wiki, meaning "quick") and encyclopedia. Wikipedia's articles provide links 
          designed to guide the user to related pages with additional information.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wikipedia is written collaboratively by largely anonymous volunteers. Anyone with 
          Internet access can write and make changes to Wikipedia articles, except in limited 
          cases where editing is restricted to prevent further disruption or vandalism. Since its 
          creation on January 15, 2001, Wikipedia has grown into the world's largest reference 
          website, attracting 1.8 billion unique-device visitors monthly as of August 2021. It 
          currently has more than fifty-seven million articles in more than 300 languages, 
          including 6,406,788 articles in English with 124,158 active contributors in the past month.

          My name is Vanjo Merano. I live in the Northern suburbs of Chicago. I created this Filipino 
          food blog, Panlasang Pinoy (The Filipino Taste), to share my best Filipino and Asian recipes 
          to everyone. As huge fan of the Filipino way of cooking, it is my goal to teach people how 
          to cook Filipino dishes  using the simplest way possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Aside for my deep passion in cooking and my continuous craving for the distinctive 
          Filipino taste, I was motivated to create cooking videos in order to promote Filipino 
          food.  I noticed that Filipino Cuisine is not well represented outside of the Philippines. 
          It is time for our food to be noticed, known, tasted, and enjoyed by the rest of the world.
