      In the previous page, we discussed the main cooking methods Filipinos use
      to prepare dishes. We will now be diving into some common recipes. We will
      only be discussing the main method used in preparing the dish and not the 
      process of creating it. If you want to prepare the dish, links to the recipes
      can be found on the <a id="link" href="references.html">references page.</a> And like we
      always say, <q>Mabuhay!</q>

    <!------------------------------------------- Tinola ----------------------------------------->
    <h2>Tinola</h2>
      <img src="images/Discussion/tinola.jpg" alt="an image of tinola">
      <p>
        Tinola is traditionally cooked with wedges of unripe papaya and malunggay 
        leaves. These components make it a good source of nutrients. The secret in 
        making a good tinola is to simmer the chicken for longer periods of time. 
        This extracts the flavor from the chicken. It also makes the chicken tender 
        in the process.
      </p>
        <br>
      <p>
        Variants of the dish can substitute chicken with fish, seafood, or pork. 
        Chayote or calabash (upo) can also be substituted for green papaya. Instead 
        of pepper leaves, other leafy vegetables can also be used like pechay, 
        spinach, moringa leaves, and mustard greens, among others. Additional 
        ingredients like potatoes and tomatoes can also be added.

    <!------------------------------------------- Inasal and Barbeque ----------------------------------------->
    <h2>Inasal and barbeque</h2>
      <img src="images/Discussion/inasal.jpg" alt="an image of inasal">
      <p>
        Chicken Inasal is a grilled chicken dish and one of the well known 
        Ilonggo dishes. This is done by marinating chicken pieces in a unique 
        blend of spices and grilling them until done. Sounds like a simple 
        grilled chicken recipe, isn’t it? Well, it might sound like one; 
        however, the special marinade and basting sauce makes this Ilonggo 
        version of the grilled chicken extra special.
      </p>
      <img src="images/Discussion/barbeque.jpg" alt="an image of barbeque">
      <p>
        Pork barbecue in bamboo skewers is what Filipino Style Pork BBQ is 
        all about. It is composed of thinly sliced pork pieces that are marinated 
        in a special mixture of seasonings and spices. In the Philippines, it is 
        normally grilled over wood charcoal and dipped in a tall jar of spicy 
        vinegar before eating.

    <!------------------------------------------- Lechon Baboy ----------------------------------------->
    <h2>Lechon Baboy</h2>
      <img src="images/Discussion/lechon.jpg" alt="an image of lechon">
      <p>
        Lechon Baboy (Pig) is another national dish of the Philippines. I prefer 
        to call it Litson in our dialect. Litson or Lechon Baboy is also known 
        as Roasted Sucklig Pig, is a famous dish and most of the time symbolizes 
        the bond that brings families and friends together for gatherings on 
        occasions especially during Fiesta (Feast). There is a difference when 
        you only use the word Lechon to refer as there is also what we call 
        Lechon Manok for Roasted Chicken or Lechon Baka for Roasted Calf. 
        Basically when you use the word Lechon, it typically means the manner 
        of cooking which is Roasting.
      </p>

      <p>
        I suppose almost everywhere in the Philippines, a celebration i.e. 
        Weddings, Birthdays, Baptism, and Graduation, would not be complete
        without a Whole Lechon served in the middle of the dining table. It is 
        basically the centerpiece or the main attraction in terms of food for 
        any occasion. That is why it is considered to be one of the Top 10 
        Delicious Foods you must try in the Philippines. Cooking Lechon requires 
        a lot of patience since its cooking time is somewhat long, roasting the 
        whole pig usually takes up to 4-5 hours over a charcoal. The cooking time 
        varies with the size and age of the pig. Ideally, to get the perfect lechon 
        it is best to cook young pigs between ages 4-6 weeks old when they are less 
        fatty and not that old. The ideal weight for pigs for Lechon Baboy is around 
        18 to 20 kilos. At this age and weight, its meat is at its finest and the 
        skin is neither too thick nor too thin.

    <!------------------------------------------- Pancit Guisado ----------------------------------------->
    <h2>Pancit Guisado</h2>
      <img src="images/Discussion/pancit-guisado.jpg" alt="an image of pancit guisado">
      <p>
        Pancit Guisado is a Filipino noodle dish. It is also known as Pancit 
        Bihon Gisado. This dish is composed of rice noodles, shredded chicken, 
        shrimp, and vegetables. The noodles are locally called bihon. The word 
        Guisado refers to the method used in cooking the dish. It simply means 
        sautéed in english.
      </p>
        <br>
      <p>
        Pancit is a symbol for long life. It is served during special occasions. 
        A typical birthday menu should have pancit. This dish also attributed to the 
        Christmas season. It is a favorite during potluck Christmas parties. It is 
        also one of the dishes that I recommend for Christmas dinner or Noche Buena.

    <!------------------------------------------- Lechon Kawali ----------------------------------------->
    <h2>Lechon Kawali</h2>
      <img src="images/Discussion/lechon-kawali.jpg" alt="an image of lechon kawali">
      <p>
        Crispy deep-fried pork is the simplest way to describe lechon kawali. Pork 
        belly or liempo is the cut of pork usually used to cook it. This dish is 
        best served for lunch or dinner with white rice on the side. It is also nice 
        to have with dipping sauce. This dish should not be mistaken with Lechon, 
        which is considered as the national dish of the Philippines. Both dishes are 
        prepared in a different manner. These also have different visual appearance.
      </p>
        <br>
      <p>
        Lechon kawali got its name from the type of cooking pan that is 
        traditionally used to cook it, the Kawali. It is the typical pan that 
        can be found in almost all Filipino household. This is the “goto” pan in 
        everyday cooking. There are two processes involved in cooking lechon 
        kawali. The first process involves boiling the pork belly, while the 
        next is deep-frying until the skin becomes crispy.
